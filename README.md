## Naming Conventions ##
 ---
- *Controllers* will be UpperCamelCase, as we can think of them as classes
that instantiate our models and create scope variables `Ex: "SkillsCtrl"`
- *Everything else* will be lowerCamelCase, `Ex: ng-app "timeExampleModule"`
- *Files* will be seperated by - `Ex: skill-app-ctrl.js`
- *Directories* will be seperated by _ `Ex: bower_components/`
