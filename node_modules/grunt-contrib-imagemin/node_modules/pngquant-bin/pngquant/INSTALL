To build pngquant from source on Mac OS X and most Linux distributions,
simply run:

      $ make

It will create pngquant executable in the current directory. If you'd like
to install it system-wide:

      $ sudo make install

By default it will be installed in /usr/local/bin. To install it in another
directory set PREFIX or DESTDIR environmental variables.

pngquant uses GNU Makefile. To compile on FreeBSD you will need to use gmake,
and on Windows the MinGW compiler (MSVC does not support C99).


##Compilation with OpenMP

     $ make openmp

This makes pngquant faster in wall-clock time on multicore machines when one
image at a time is processed.

However, it significantly increases total CPU time used, and thus it's not
recommended for server-side and parallelized batch jobs which run many pngquant
instances at a time.


##Compilation with Cocoa image reader

     $ make USE_COCOA=1

On Mac OS X pngquant can use Cocoa framework to load images. This enables
support for color profiles and other input file formats.


##Compilation of `libimagequant.a` only

If you want to use pngquant's conversion algorithm without loading/saving PNG
files, then you can run make in `lib/` directory.
The library doesn't need libpng or zlib.
